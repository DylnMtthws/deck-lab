"""The ``cost:*`` family: how a card can be paid for, and what else it demands.

This is the family the plan's driving example needs — *"which cards can be cast
without paying mana, and which of those are legal in this identity"* — and it is
first for that reason.

Two distinctions run through the whole family and are worth stating once:

**A cost the card imposes on itself is not a cost it imposes on other spells.**
"You may pay {1} rather than pay this spell's mana cost" is an alternative cost;
"Spells you cast cost {1} less" is a cost *modifier*. They read alike and answer
different questions, so they are different tags and each names the other in its
limitations.

**An alternative cost is not a free cast.** Force of Will has an alternative
cost that happens to contain no mana; Bringer of the Black Dawn has one that
contains five. ``cost:alternative_cast_cost`` covers both, and
``cost:free_alternative_cost`` is the strictly narrower claim.
