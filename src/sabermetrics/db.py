"""Central SQLite access layer.

A single place that opens connections (so connection configuration is
consistent), plus thin repositories for the most-duplicated query shapes and a
helper for hydrating Pydantic models from rows. This replaces the pattern of
each module calling ``sqlite3.connect()`` directly with its own ad-hoc setup.

Connection policy:

- ``row_factory`` defaults to :class:`sqlite3.Row`. A ``Row`` supports positional
  (``row[0]``), keyed (``row["col"]``), iteration, and ``dict(row)`` access, so
  it is a safe superset of what existing call sites expect.
- ``foreign_keys`` is intentionally **not** forced on. The schema is created with
  foreign keys enabled (``scripts/setup_db.py``), but application connections
  have historically run with SQLite's per-connection default (off). Turning it on
  globally here could reject inserts that currently succeed, so it stays opt-in.
- Every connection sets a five-second busy timeout and WAL journal mode. WAL is
  persistent, but setting it idempotently also hardens a newly copied database.
