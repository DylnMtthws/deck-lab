#: under ``sabermetrics``. Notably absent and absent on purpose:
#: ``sabermetrics.db`` and ``sabermetrics.config`` (the assistant needs
#: neither), ``cedh.packs`` (``assistant/context.py`` reads the pack YAML as

#: ``mechanics/tags/``, where the plan requires one definition file per tag
#: family and every family shares one predicate algebra — so the two rules come
#: apart, and the one that was always meant is the latter.

#: The three invariants the purity rule exists for are untouched and still
#: asserted below: no sibling package, no third-party import, no filesystem.
