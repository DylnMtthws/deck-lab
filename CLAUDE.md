## Project Identity

- **Name:** Sabermetrics for Magic
- **Type:** Multi-user, single-machine web app — currently a **closed beta** (owner-invited testers). Was a single-user personal tool through the P8 build; pivoted 2026-07 (see ADR-015..018); pivoted again 2026-09 to a **cEDH Deck Lab** (see ADR-019..025), and moved to a managed container host in ADR-028.
- **Product direction (2026-09):** The product is exclusively a **cEDH Deck Lab**. It is no longer a general casual Commander power-level generator. The casual generator still ships and still works, but it is legacy: new work goes into `src/sabermetrics/cedh/`.
- **Owner / Admin:** Dylan Matthews (sole admin; provisions all accounts)
- **Purpose:** Build competitive Commander (cEDH) deck candidates deterministically from curated strategy packs, ground them in tournament evidence with stated sample sizes, validate them against a goldfishing simulator, and explain them. **There is no budget and no price anywhere in the cEDH engine** — cEDH is proxy-normal, so the objective is performance (ADR-025).
- **Phase 1 goal:** Invite trusted Magic players, let them generate decks and leave thumbs-up/down + comments per card (and a verdict per deck); the owner + Claude mine that feedback to improve the generator.
- **Inspiration:** Sabermetric "moneyball" methodology in professional sports analytics — find cards with the best cost-to-impact ratio.

### What this repository owns

## Critical Constraints (Hard Requirements)

These constraints are non-negotiable. Every code generation must respect them.

```yaml
constraints:
  users: "multi-user, admin-provisioned only — NO self-registration; the admin creates every account (ADR-015)"
  hosting: "production is one Python 3.11 container on one managed machine, behind the platform TLS proxy, with SQLite on one persistent volume (ADR-028). Binding 0.0.0.0 is allowed only inside that container. No direct host port-forward and no second app machine while SQLite is app state. The Mac/tailscale serve shape remains a valid local or private-tailnet alternative."
  auth: "THREE MODES via SABER_AUTH_MODE. `hybrid` (production): password login for public proxy traffic and tailnet identity when those trusted headers are actually present. `tailscale` (local/private tailnet): identity from `tailscale serve`; no password form. `password` (local dev + tests): email + argon2id + invite links. ALL modes are admin-provisioned — no self-registration, and an unknown tailnet identity is REFUSED (ADR-015). Header trust requires a Tailscale CGNAT source and no Funnel marker; TRUST_TAILSCALE_HEADERS_FROM_ANY_ADDRESS is test-only and raises outside TESTING. Public mode requires a stable secret, CSRF on every POST, Secure/SameSite cookies, HSTS, login throttling, account lockout, and per-user authorization."
  per_user_quota: "20 generated decks per calendar month (admin-overridable per user); resets on the 1st (ADR-017)"
  cost_ceiling: "global monthly $ ceiling remains the ultimate hard stop across ALL users (settings.llm.monthly_cost_ceiling_usd)"
  # Feedback-collection input (thumbs + comments from testers) is the point of Phase 1 and is NOT the forbidden 'manual data entry' below — that rule bars manual entry of the CARD/PRICE/METRIC corpus, which stays fully automated.
  manual_data_entry: "forbidden for the card/price/metric corpus (still fully automated via APIs + structured scrapes)"
  human_in_the_loop: "forbidden in the data-acquisition pipeline (does NOT apply to user feedback)"
  excluded_data_sources:
    - youtube_event_scraping  # Validation gap unacceptable
    - personal_pod_logging    # Breaks "no manual input" principle
    - manual_winner_labeling  # Breaks "no manual input" principle
  annual_cost_target_usd: 30  # LLM spend only; hosting is budgeted separately
  annual_cost_ceiling_usd: 100  # LLM spend only; hosting is budgeted separately
  per_deck_cost_target_usd: 0.15
  per_deck_cost_ceiling_usd: 0.50
  format_scope: "Commander (EDH) only; the NEW path is competitive (cEDH) only"
  ui_scope: "Desktop-first web UI; three portals — user-facing, admin (/admin), cEDH lab (/lab). Mobile IS in scope: the Deck Lab refactor ships a @media (max-width:767px) breakpoint, a drawer and safe-area insets in deck-lab.css. This line previously excluded mobile and was corrected in R0 to match the shipped CSS."

  # --- cEDH path (ADR-019..024). Non-negotiable. ---
  cedh_data_boundary: "production repositories query mtg_v1 ONLY, as mtg_consumer. No query may name mtg_internal (assert_v1_only enforces it). The card view is card_any_medium, NEVER card — the default view silently drops 254 Reserved List cards including Tropical Island, Mox Diamond and Lotus Petal."
  cedh_no_network_in_generation: "the cEDH generation path never calls EDHTop16, Scryfall, TopDeck or a deck-hosting site. Strategy material is curated in config/cedh_evidence/, reviewed and versioned."
  cedh_no_legacy_ingestion: "no module under src/sabermetrics/cedh/ imports sabermetrics.ingestion, .pipeline, .reasoning or .analytics, or any vendor model SDK. Asserted by tests over the import graph."
  llm_may_not: "decide legality; invent cards or oracle text; bypass candidate constraints; create simulator mechanics; silently repair a malformed simulator result; select from the whole card corpus without deterministic narrowing."
  llm_may: "normalize free-text intent; select among supported strategy packs; summarize retrieved tournament evidence; compare deterministic alternatives; explain recommendations."
  structured_output: "every machine-used model response uses provider structured output and is validated with Pydantic before use. A response that never validates raises; it is never partially accepted."
  provider_pinning: "production pins the provider (model id ends ':deepinfra'). Dynamic ':cheapest' routing is refused — it makes the recorded model id a guess."
  absence_is_visible: "no tournament data renders as 'no tournament evidence', never an empty result. No simulator renders as 'not simulated', NEVER an invented neutral score. An unsupported commander renders as unsupported."
  popularity_is_not_quality: "an inclusion rate is displayed with its denominator, window and event-size floor, or not displayed."
  no_price_in_the_engine: "the cEDH engine has NO budget and NO price. CardFacts carries no price field, adapters_postgres does not select rep_prices, BuildConstraints has no budget_usd (and sets extra='forbid' so a stale caller passing one FAILS rather than being silently ignored), the UI offers no budget input, and the prompts forbid the model from mentioning cost. Do not reintroduce price 'just for display' — a price field that exists becomes a tie-break. (ADR-025)"
  no_collection_in_the_engine: "the engine does not know who is asking. NO owned-cards / collection input: BuildConstraints has no owned_oracle_ids, IntentClassification has no mentions_owned_cards, and _sort_key takes (oracle_id, pack, role) only. Acquiring or proxying cards for a new deck is the normal case. Consequence worth preserving: a build is reproducible from the pack alone, so the candidate deck_sha256 identifies a LIST, not a list-plus-requester. (ADR-025) This is now enforced ACROSS the repo boundary: deck_sha256 covers sorted commander oracle_ids plus the sorted library with quantities and NOTHING else -- not the strategy pack, not the simulator, not the corpus -- and commander_simulator recomputes it independently and returns its own value, which is the only field compared for deck integrity. Everything that affects the NUMBERS lives in a separate simulation_input_sha256 the simulator computes and we merely carry. Pinned in all three implementations by fixtures/cedh/contracts/hash-golden-vectors.json. Do not add anything to deck_sha256; a pack, a seed or a version in there re-creates the exact bug this replaced, where an identical deck under a different pack read as a different deck."
```

> **Charter note:** This project began as a strictly single-user, localhost-only, budget-focused tool (constraints `user_count: 1`, localhost-only, "no multi-user / no public hosting"). The owner deliberately pivoted it in 2026-07 to a multi-user feedback platform. The constraints above reflect the new charter; ADR-015..018 record the decision and rationale.

<context name="core_value_proposition">

## Core Value Proposition

Existing EDH tools (EDHREC, edhpowerlevel, Moxfield analyzer) are **frequency counters with weighted heuristics**. They recommend cards based on what other players include.

This tool **reasons about why a commander wants specific cards**, grounded in:
1. The card's actual mechanical text
2. Aggregated player behavior (corroboration, not authority)
3. Community discussion (cultural signal)
4. Official rules and strategic frameworks (RAG grounding)

The differentiation is strategic comprehension, not better algorithms. LLM reasoning makes this possible at affordable cost via aggressive prompt caching and a three-tier filter pipeline.

</context>

<context name="architectural_principles">

## Architectural Principles

When implementation choices arise that aren't explicitly specified, resolve them using these principles in priority order:

1. **Locality over distribution** — one single-process Python app on one machine; use only the explicit Postgres and simulator service boundaries, with no broker or internal microservices
2. **Lazy computation over eager** — generate profiles on-demand for active commanders, never pre-compute all 25,000 cards
3. **Reasoning layered over reasoning required** — cheap deterministic filters narrow candidates before expensive LLM calls
4. **Evidence triangulation over single-source truth** — fuse card text + behavioral data + community discussion
5. **Reference grounding over pure generation** — LLM reasoning is RAG-augmented with rules and frameworks
6. **Cache hierarchically** — different TTLs aligned to data volatility (permanent / quarterly / weekly / daily / per-session)
7. **Observable over opaque** — every output cites sources and exposes confidence
8. **Bounded cost over unbounded capability** — every operation has a budget; never trade indefinite cost growth for marginal capability

<context name="excluded_capabilities">

## Explicitly Excluded Capabilities

Do not implement these. They have been considered and rejected:

- YouTube event scraping (validation gap)
- Personal pod game logging (manual input)
- ~~Multi-user support~~ — **now in scope** as of the 2026-07 pivot (ADR-015); admin-provisioned accounts only, no self-registration
- ~~Public hosting~~ — **now in scope** as one managed container behind the platform proxy (ADR-028); no direct host port-forward and no second app machine while SQLite is app state
- Real-time gameplay assistance (architectural mismatch)
- Mobile UI (out of scope)
- Card image rendering (cosmetic, deferred)
- Full game-theory-optimal play modeling (research-grade)
- ~~Goldfish simulation in V1~~ — **now in scope** for cEDH through the versioned private HTTP simulator contract; multiplayer/game-theory simulation remains excluded
- Multi-player simulation in V1 (deferred to V2)
- Arena/Standard/Limited format support (Commander only)
- Untapped.gg or 17lands data ingestion (wrong format)

<context name="cost_discipline">

## Cost Discipline

Every LLM call must:
1. Pass through `src/reasoning/client.py` wrapper
2. Use prompt caching where reusable context exists
3. Log token usage and computed cost to `cost_log` table
4. Respect monthly cost ceiling (default $5/mo, configurable)
5. Use the cheapest model that meets quality requirements (Haiku by default; Sonnet only when warranted)

Cost call distribution per deck generation (target):

```yaml
deck_generation_cost_breakdown:
  profile_synthesis:
    when: "cache miss only (~1 in 50 generations)"
    model: claude-sonnet-4-6
    cost: ~$0.40
  per_card_fit_scoring:
    count: 50
    model: claude-haiku-4-5
    cost_each: ~$0.001
    total: ~$0.05
    caching: "profile + reference chunks cached across all 50 calls"
  deck_synthesis:
    count: 1
    model: claude-sonnet-4-6
    cost: ~$0.05
  typical_total_per_deck: "~$0.10 (cache hit) or ~$0.50 (cache miss)"

<context name="architectural_decisions">

## Key Architectural Decisions (ADR Summary)

These decisions are settled. Do not relitigate in code; refer here for the "why."

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| ADR-001 | Lazy profile generation | Eager is 50x more expensive and stale |
| ADR-002 | SQLite over Postgres | Single-user; embedded DB simpler |
| ADR-003 | numpy cosine over vector DB | <10K chunks; numpy is sub-ms |
| ADR-004 | 3-call LLM pattern with caching | 94% cost reduction vs single mega-prompt |
| ADR-005 | Triangulated evidence | Each source has blind spots |
| ADR-006 | RAG grounding required | Prevents hallucinated synergies |
| ADR-007 | No YouTube data | Validation gap unacceptable |
| ADR-008 | Mac mini self-hosted | Free, already owned |
| ADR-009 | Layered architecture | Microservices solve problems we don't have |
| ADR-010 | Quarterly refresh cadence | Aligns with Magic set releases |
| ADR-011 | Sonnet for the batched fit vet, Sonnet for synthesis, Haiku for screening | Old 12x pricing is stale (Haiku→Sonnet is 3x, Sonnet→Opus 1.67x); one batched vet call is cheaper than per-card Haiku was, and Haiku miscalibrated borderline judgment |
| ADR-012 | Profile cache w/ set-version invalidation | Cheap relevance screening |
| ADR-013 | mtgapi for rulings only, Scryfall for cards | Scryfall has bulk + prices; mtgapi has inline rulings |
| ADR-014 | Rulings join by oracle_id | Rulings persist across reprints |
| ADR-015 | Multi-user, admin-provisioned accounts (no self-register); one-time invite links | Owner controls exactly who can spend tokens; invite links avoid ever sharing/handling passwords |
| ADR-016 | Internet exposure via Cloudflare Tunnel; app stays bound to 127.0.0.1 behind it | Keeps "self-hosted on the Mac mini", free, no port-forwarding; the app is never directly exposed — a real security win over binding 0.0.0.0 |
| ADR-017 | Per-user quota: 20 decks/calendar month (admin-overridable) + retained global $ ceiling | Caps token spend per tester while a global hard stop bounds total cost across everyone |
| ADR-018 | Structured per-card (thumbs+comment) and per-deck (verdict+comment) feedback loop | Phase-1 product goal: harvest deck-literate players' judgments to measure and improve generator quality; this feedback is user input, distinct from the still-automated data corpus |

| ADR-019 | cEDH only; casual power levels removed from the new path | The product is a cEDH Deck Lab. Power-level heuristics answer a different question than "does this list win a tournament round" |
| ADR-020 | Card and tournament facts come from `mtg_v1` through repository interfaces; `card_any_medium`, never `card` | The schema is the contract and the boundary is one adapter. The default `card` view silently drops Reserved List staples, which is the worst failure mode: fewer rows and a success return |
| ADR-021 | Provider-neutral `ModelGateway`; DeepSeek-V4-Flash on DeepInfra, structured output required | A vendor SDK in the generation path makes the provider a rewrite. Structured output plus Pydantic validation is what stops "explain this deck" becoming "invent a deck" |
| ADR-022 | Deterministic construction from curated strategy packs; the model never selects a card | Selection finishes before the first model call, so a provider outage costs prose and nothing else. It is also the only mechanism that actually prevents corpus-wide hallucination |
| ADR-023 | Simulator boundary is versioned JSON; production uses private HTTP and the corrected subprocess client remains available locally; absence is a visible "not simulated" | A neutral score is indistinguishable from a measured one once it is in a table. The simulator's own honesty fields are required, so the number cannot be rendered without them |
| ADR-024 | One cost ledger and one monthly ceiling across both providers | A per-provider ceiling is two soft limits, not one hard stop |
| ADR-027 | Public exposure via Tailscale Funnel is opt-in (`SABER_PUBLIC=1`) and forces `hybrid` auth, a mandatory stable secret key, HSTS, and per-ACCOUNT login lockout | Funnel traffic is anonymous, so a public visitor cannot arrive authenticated and must have a password path. Once /login faces the internet, IP rate limiting alone is weak — an attacker rotates addresses and Funnel traffic may share one — so 5 failures lock the account for 15 minutes, and a locked account refuses even the correct password |
| ADR-026 | Tailnet-only hosting via `tailscale serve`; identity from its proxy headers; accounts still admin-provisioned | The Cloudflare Tunnel (ADR-016) was specified and never deployed. A tunnel puts a login page on the public internet where anyone can knock; a tailnet has no public surface at all, and Tailscale has already authenticated every device on it. Removes passwords, invite tokens, the login form and the reset flow nobody had built yet — one `grant-access` command per tester. Accounts stay because owner-scoping, quota and per-card feedback all need identity |
| ADR-025 | No budget, no card price, and no collection anywhere in the cEDH engine | cEDH is proxy-normal: expensive cards get proxied, so price is not a performance signal, and a budget would not trade money for power — it would just remove the best cards. Owned-cards preference is the same constraint wearing a different hat: building a new deck means acquiring or proxying cards, which is the normal case. Absence is enforced (no field to read, `extra="forbid"` on the constraints) because an available price or collection field always becomes a tie-break eventually. It also buys reproducibility: selection sees only the pack and the role, so the same pack yields the same 99 for everyone. NB: this is about *card* prices — the LLM **token** cost ceiling (ADR-024) is untouched |
| ADR-028 | One managed production container; SQLite on one volume; `hybrid` auth; simulator over private HTTP; `mtg_v1` over TLS | Supersedes ADR-008's cloud-cost rejection and ADR-026's tailnet-only production posture. One machine preserves SQLite correctness and the single-process design while invited testers gain a public URL. Hosting is budgeted separately from the LLM-only annual target; see `docs/deployment.md`. |
| ADR-029 | Ask may render typed, cited Interpretation assertions | A mechanically grounded assessment is useful, but it must remain visibly distinct from facts and measurements and state what its evidence does not establish; see `docs/research-assistant-adrs.md` |
| ADR-030 | Ask lives beside `cedh/`; the model plans and narrates bounded deterministic results | The dependency must not leak backward into deterministic generation or inherit the legacy casual/budget objective; see `docs/research-assistant-adrs.md` |

> **Charter pivot (2026-07):** ADR-015..018 supersede the original single-user / localhost-only / no-public-hosting posture. Where older ADRs or docs assume one user, the multi-user charter above wins.
>
> **Product pivot (2026-09):** ADR-019..025 make the product a cEDH Deck Lab. Where older ADRs describe casual power levels, budget-as-objective, or local ingestion as the source of card facts, they describe the **legacy** path only. `src/sabermetrics/cedh/` is the product.
>
> **Hosting pivot (2026-09):** ADR-028 supersedes ADR-008 and ADR-026 for production. The Tailscale mode remains supported for local/private use; production is one managed container with `hybrid` auth.

Full text for ADR-001..014 is in `design.md` Section 11. **ADR-015..027 have
no prose anywhere in the repository** — they exist only as the one-line rows
above, and `docs/project_plan/sabermetrics_v2_spec.md` §3 separately defines a
*different* ADR-015..020, so those numbers collide. Write new ADRs to a named
doc and link them from the table, as ADR-028..030 do. ADR-028's full rationale
and operating consequences are in `docs/deployment.md`; ADR-029 and ADR-030 are
in `docs/research-assistant-adrs.md`.

## Current Build Status

Track progress here. Update as phases complete.

```yaml
status:
  original_build: "Complete — P1..P8 (single-user generator). Refresh automation, launchd plists, JSON logging, Karsten mana analysis, deep statistical profiles."
  current_initiative: "cEDH Deck Lab (ADR-019..025) on the ADR-028 managed-container deployment shape. The multi-user + feedback beta (P0..P6) is complete and is now the legacy path."
  current_phase: "Research Assistant R0..R3 built. R3 (Query IR + deterministic executor, gate G2) ships the plan schema, the executor, the deck-context resolver and 80 hand-written plans; the G2 claim itself is measured but NOT authoritative — the plans and the id map await owner review, the golden set is still `contested`, and the reference index is not built. Cloud alignment W1..W9 complete; deployment is a separate, deliberate phase."
  portal_completed: ["P0", "P1", "P2", "P3", "P4", "P5", "P6"]
  in_progress: []
  blocked: []
  cloud_alignment: "One linux/amd64 Python 3.11 container, one machine, SQLite volume, hybrid auth, mtg_v1 over TLS, simulator over private HTTP with cedh-simulation-result.v3 validation. No image was published and no deployment was performed."
  research_assistant_notes: "src/sabermetrics/{mechanics,substrate,assistant}/ hold the Ask path, beside cedh/ (ADR-030). R3 added assistant/ir.py (the ResearchPlan DAG: seven step kinds, deferred kinds named with their owning phase, and a hard refusal of any Oracle-id literal or allowed_oracle_ids entry — deck scoping is scope='deck' and the EXECUTOR injects the ids, which is what stops a hand-written plan scoring recall by naming its answer), assistant/envelope.py (StepResult | StepNotRun with no-default provenance/coverage/field/availability/ordering; `truncated` and `set_input_incomplete` are separate flags on purpose), assistant/sources.py (CardSource/RulesSource protocols; imports reference_layer.retriever ONLY, never .evidence, which reaches into db/analytics/ingestion), assistant/context.py (resolves cedh:kinnan-basalt-fixture and cedh:kinnan-healthy-baseline by reading config/cedh_packs YAML as data; the baseline is a declared ALIAS of the same pack; publishes pack_sha256 and deliberately NO deck hash), assistant/executor.py, and assistant/eval/{plans,runner,g2}.py. The 80 hand-written plans live in fixtures/research/r3_plans/, one file per golden-question category. G2 is scored by assistant/eval/g2.py, which counts fully-answered questions rather than mean recall, names its 47-question denominator, lists the 33 questions it excludes, and marks the absence/clarification gates `declared_not_measured` and the no-finding gate `not_measured` because R3 has no narrator. Substrate additions: CardRetrievalFacade.records() (the UNBOUNDED structured path — search() caps at result_limit=50 and reading a capped ranking as a population corrupts any downstream intersect) and Catalog.resolve_names()."
  cedh_notes: "src/sabermetrics/cedh/ holds the whole path. repositories.py defines CardRepository/MetaRepository and the assert_v1_only guard. adapters_postgres.py reads card_any_medium/card_face/card_legality and derives tournament evidence from the canonical tournament, tournament_entry, deck, deck_commander, deck_card, and card_any_medium views. PostgresMetaRepository probes required columns and grants separately for summaries and inclusion, then loads one cohort in a read-only repeatable-read snapshot. adapters_fixture.py mirrors those atomic facts offline. evidence.py emits attributed, bounded Deck Lab cohort aggregates with the exact window, denominator, and incomplete-deck count. model_gateway.py is provider-neutral; builder.py is deterministic and legality-repaired; simulator.py uses SimulationResult | NotSimulated and its wire format is versioned separately. The UI is at /lab and the CLI at `sabermetrics cedh`. The Kinnan pack's 99 ARE the list commander_simulator models."
  legacy_notes: "P0 schema; P1 auth (Flask-Login, invites, hardening, create-admin/invite-user CLI); P2 admin user mgmt (/admin, role-gated). Tailwind (PR#11) merged to main; portal branch rebased on it. P3: user portal — db.py FavoritesRepo (commanders+decks toggle/list/ids) + DecksRepo (list_for_owner, owner_of, set_owner, count_this_month) + UsersRepo.update_profile; ui/explore_filters.py (pure WHERE builder over commander_candidates: colors atmost/exactly, abilities=keywords LIKE, price/cmc ranges, sort, pagination); routes: home dashboard (quota meter, recent decks, fav shortcuts), /explore (filter sidebar + hearts + pagination), /favorites/commanders, /favorites/decks, /decks (owner-scoped, delete), /profile (edit + change password), favorite toggle endpoints (JSON, CSRF via X-CSRFToken). Owner-scoping: generate sets owner_id; view/delete/deck-fav authorized (owner or admin → else 403). Templates all Tailwind (home/explore/decks/favorites_*/profile + _macros.html + build form moved to profile_view). index.html DELETED. P4: quota ENFORCED in generate route — global $ ceiling pre-check (503) + per-user calendar-month count vs quota (429 with reset label); mid-build LLMCostCeilingExceeded handled. Cost attribution: contextvars + cost_attribution() CM in reasoning/client.py, _log_cost writes cost_log.user_id/deck_id; route wraps builder.build in cost_attribution(owner, deck_id) with a PRE-MINTED deck_id passed via new DeckBuildRequest.owner_id/deck_id fields (_build_deck_model uses request.deck_id). CLI builds unattributed. PR #12 (P0-P4) MERGED to main; P5+ on new branches. P5: feedback system (the Phase-1 payload). db.py FeedbackRepo (upsert_card ON CONFLICT user/deck/card, upsert_deck ON CONFLICT user/deck, card_map, deck read helpers). Routes: POST /deck/<id>/card/<card_id>/feedback and POST /deck/<id>/feedback — OWNER-ONLY (owner_of == current_user, else 403; admins viewing others' decks get read-only, can_feedback=False). deck_view.html: per-card thumbs+comment cell in the by-type table (prefilled from card_feedback map) + deck-level verdict(good/mixed/bad)+comment panel + feedback JS (autosave, CSRF X-CSRFToken); styles in style.css (.fb-thumb/.verdict-btn). Per-card feedback is ONLY in the by-type table view (default), not by-role/visual — deferred. P5 PR#13 MERGED to main. P6: admin analytics (db.py AdminAnalyticsRepo). Routes on /admin: enhanced overview (KPIs), users (per_user_stats: decks/spend/feedback + detail link), users/<id> drill-down, feedback explorer (card_feedback aggregated by card_name — up/down/net/total/comments, sortable) + feedback/card/<name> drill (all comments) + feedback/export?format=csv|json (CSV=card rows, JSON=card+deck), costs (totals + by call_type + by user, uses cost_log.user_id from P4), commanders (most-generated + most-favorited). Templates admin/feedback|feedback_card|costs|commanders|user_detail + enriched overview/users; admin nav gained Feedback/Costs/Commanders. NB: feedback rows are intentionally KEPT on deck delete (research data; aggregates group by card_name, LEFT JOIN decks). Tests: test_admin_analytics.py. NEXT: P7 deploy — waitress + Cloudflare Tunnel setup doc; set real SABER_SECRET_KEY; run /security-review BEFORE sharing the tunnel URL (release gate)."
